% 3. Header (and Footer)
\pagestyle{fancy} % With this command we can customize the header style.
\fancyhf{} % This makes sure we do not have other information in our header or footer.
\lhead{\footnotesize  CS 6140}% \lhead puts text in the top left corner. \footnotesize sets our font to a smaller size.
%\rhead works just like \lhead (you can also use \chead)
\rhead{\footnotesize homework 1} %<---- Fill in your lastnames.
% Similar commands work for the footer (\lfoot, \cfoot and \rfoot).
% We want to put our page number in the center.
\cfoot{\footnotesize \thepage} 

\begin{document}
\thispagestyle{empty} % This command disables the header on the first page. 

\begin{tabular}{p{15.5cm}} % This is a simple tabular environment to align your text nicely 
{\large \bf CS 6140 Machine Learning} \\

\hline % \hline produces horizontal lines.
\end{tabular} % Our tabular environment ends here.

\vspace*{0.3cm} % Now we want to add some vertical space in between the line and our title.

\begin{center} % Everything within the center environment is centered.
