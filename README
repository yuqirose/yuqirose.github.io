The site makes use of the jQuery Backstretch plugin 
from Scott Robbin. Gracias.

=============================

This simple one-page website is a way for people to have a very quick and easy personable website that aggregates your activity and positions a simple logo, a portrait and some description text in a nicely-formatted manner. This is licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses. 

See the original: http://nazhamid.com

Usage is simple:

1) You'll need to edit the index.html file with your own text.

2) Upload your own logo in place of monogram.png. Your initials will likely not be NH, but if they are, be smart and use your own little monogram/logo. 

3) Upload your own portrait as the background. Don't impersonate me!

4) Upload all the files, including the MIT and GPL licences. 

5) You can switch the position of the monogram and text as seen in timlum.com.

Change Notes:
=============================

v1.1
— Added responsive design for mobile devices
— Mobile devices no longer load the background image to save the bandwidth and performance hit.
