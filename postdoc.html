                       <p>
                        We seek exceptional postdoctoral candidates to be hosted at UCSD/HDSI, Columbia, or UCI. These positions have an initial term of one year with the possibility of extension. The starting date is flexible, but no later than Fall 2022.
                        </p>
    
                        <h5>Background</h5>
                        <p>
                            The past two decades have witnessed natural disasters and extreme weather events that affect millions of
lives. At the same time, the data volume from high-resolution climate models, satellite, in-situ and
ground-based measurements have substantially increased to petabyte scales. These new and readily
accessible datasets create the previously missing pipeline for scientific machine learning (ML), which in turn can improve our understanding and ability to predict extreme climate events. 

                        </p>
                        <p></p>

                        This project will develop deep latent variable models (LVMs) to discover hidden physical structures in high-dimensional, spatiotemporal data of extreme climate events such as droughts or heatwaves.                     </p>

                    <h3> Postdoc in Representation Learning Foundations of Deep Learning </h3>
                       <p>
                           We seek exceptional postdoctoral candidates hosted at UCSD <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/"> Computer Science & Engineering </a> by Prof. <a href="index.html">Rose Yu </a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://mathserver.neu.edu/robin/"> Robin Walters</a> and <a href="https://jwvdm.github.io/">Jan-Willem Van Der Meernt</a>.  The initial term of these positions is 1 year with possibility of extension. The target start date is early 2022 but is flexible.
                        </p>
    
                        <h5>Background</h5>
                        <p>
                            In the past decade, deep learning has had transformative impacts across society. However, progress has often relied on heuristic methods with limited theoretical understanding. 
                            Symmetry plays a key role in human reasoning. Representation theory, which is the mathematical study of symmetry, offers new tools to broaden research into why deep learning works. 
                        </p>
                        <p></p>

                            The goal of the research is to understand the role of representation theory in enabling efficient optimization and improved generalization of deep learning even in domains with approximate or unknown symmetry. This project pursues three lines of research that will broaden the impact of representation theory in deep learning beyond strict inductive biases. The first is the trade-off between the degree of symmetry in the model and the degree of symmetry in the domain. This line of research will study networks that combine equivariant and non-equivariant features. The second line of research will examine learning symmetry directly from data to improve generalization in domains without known symmetries. The third aim is to develop a theoretical basis for deep learning using quiver representations. This perspective reveals the symmetry of the structure of deep-learning models themselves, through their parameter spaces, even when the domains have no obvious symmetry.

                        multi-agent team behavior modeling, and  atmospheric turbulence simulation</a>.
